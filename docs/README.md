## The game
Sewer Survivor takes place in a desertic area where a company of people called "The Sewer Crew" have to survive while finding a cure for a disease that has caused the apocallypsis. They will have to find the cure in less than 7 days or they will be done for! Will you be able to find the cure in Sewer Survivor?

### Types of agents:

They are the ones that will investigate the cure during the day. They also cure the humans temporarily of the disease.

Militar

The militars will defend your base from zombies and will recollect food for the humans of the camp to consume and to create more militars and humans.

Zombie

Zombies will try to enter your citadel and kill everyone inside, so be careful. Only some fences are preventing them from entering. They will break them, but you can fix them to contain them some time outside the camp in order for the militars to kill them.
